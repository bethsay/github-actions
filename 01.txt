You probably have a fine-grained Personal Access Token created at https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens.
If you dont have a PAT, Generate a new one. Ensure a short expiry is set. Copy the token into your system.
    #vim ~/.github_pat

Permissions 1 : Contents (Read & Write)
This allows you to clone, pull, and push code from any local git to github repos.
If your repo is public, clone and pull is allowed without PAT, but push requires PAT with Contents permission
If you already have an ssh key.pub uploaded into your Github account, PAT with Contents permission is just redundant.
Before you can use PAT, you need gh-cli installed
gh-cli package is available ubuntu.source, but it is often a couple versions behind the githubsource
    #gh --version
    #wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
    #echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list
    #apt update && apt install gh
    #gh --version
    #gh auth status
    #gh auth login --with-token < ~/.github_pat
        ->You could directly use your token using the flag "--with-token <github_pat>"
        ->Skipping the "--with-token" flag allows for an interactive gh auth login process
    #gh auth status
    #gh auth setup-git
        ->gh sets itself as the credential helper in ~/.gitconfig
Now your github_pat would be used for clone, pull and push.

Permission 2 : Workflows (Read and Write) + Actions (Read and Write)
Github Actions(gha) are yaml scripts that perform automations via Github Runners
Only yaml files present within ".github/workflows/" folder of your repo will be considered as gha.
The Workflows permission allows you git push commits that contain ".github/workflows/*.{yaml,yml}" files
Github Runners are temp VMs owned by github. A Runner exists only for the duration of the job it runs.
The Actions permission allows us to manage workflows and workflow runs.
    #cd <repo_clone>
    #git switch main
    #gh workflow list
    #gh workflow view <workflow_id>
    #gh workflow run <workflow_id>
Only workflows that exists on main, ie, default branch, can be managed with "gh workflow" and "gh run" commands.
Only workflows that exists on main, ie, default branch, can be triggered by workflow_dipatch via https://github.com/username/repository/actions/workflows/action-name.yml
    #gh run list
    #gh run watch <run_id>
    #gh run view <run_id>
    #gh run rerun <run_id>
Workflows of any branch can run using any trigger, except for workflow_dipatch
Workflows of any branch can be rerun if it is listed with a run_id

Permission 3 : Variables (Read and Write) + Secrets (Read and Write)
    #cd <repo_clone>
    #gh secret list
    #gh secret list -R <username/remote-repo>
    #gh secret set <KEY> --body <value> -R <username/remote-repo>
I had created an IAM account by performing "terraform apply" in 02-aws-iam folder of terraform repo
    #cd terraform/02-aws-iam
    #terraform apply -var-file temp.tfvars
    #terraform output
Output contains api_access and api_secret. I needed to use these as secrets of this repo, ie, github-actions
    #terraform output -raw api_access
    #gh secret set AWS_IAM_ACCESS_KEY -b "$(!-1)" -R bethsay/github-actions
    #terraform output -raw api_secret
    #gh secret set AWS_IAM_SECRET_KEY -b "$(!-1)" -r bethsay/github-actions
    #cd github-actions
    #gh secret list
    #gh workflow list
    #gh workflow run 'Create S3 Bucket'
    #gh run list
    #aws s3 ls
Cleanup,
    #cd github-actions
    #aws s3 rb "s3://terraform-backend-58fd44e0"
    #gh secret delete AWS_IAM_ACCESS_KEY
    #gh secret delete AWS_IAM_SECRET_KEY
    #cd terraform/02-aws-iam
    #terraform destroy
